if you want to run these project in your system please change the IP address in the client code

these project is bassically works on the connecting server machine to the client machin with the help of java socket programing 

working :

1)MESSAGE TRANSFER and SOCKET PROGRAMING :

here we have coonected the host with client by 2 inpute streams and 2 output streams which works together simultaneously with the help of the multithreading 
here multithreading simulates the 4 threades where two threads are working for input and output streams of server and other two works for input and ouput streams of 
client .

2)GUI :

here for GUI we have used the Swing toolkit .

we have created a window and arranged all components in the borderd layout in Swing JAVA
there are four components :
1) lable (which indicates client or server at top)
2) Message Area (to show the messages to the users )
3) Inpute area ( to type the message )
4) Send Button (to send the message to server-to-client and vise versa )
